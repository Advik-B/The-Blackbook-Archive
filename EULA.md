**PLEASE READ THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ("EULA") CAREFULLY BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE.**

The Software includes the application, associated media, printed materials, and "online" or electronic documentation.

By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Software or any associated compiled "Build," You agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If You do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not install or use the Software or any Build thereof.

**1. DEFINITIONS**
    a. "Software" refers to the application **The Blackbook Archive**, including its source code and any compiled forms.
    b. "Source Code" refers to the human-readable code of the Software, made available by Licensor at **https://github.com/Advik-B/The-Blackbook-Archive**.
    c. "Build" refers to any compiled, executable, installable, or distributable version of the Software derived from the Source Code, intended for end-user installation or execution. This includes, but is not limited to, formats such as `.exe`, `.apk`, `.dmg`, `.deb`, Docker images, virtual machine images, web application deployments, or any other packaged form designed for deployment or use by an end-user.

    e. "Official Build" refers to a Build compiled and distributed directly by the Licensor or their explicitly authorized distributors.

**2. SOURCE CODE AVAILABILITY**
    Licensor makes the Source Code for the Software available under the terms described herein and potentially detailed further in a separate file (e.g., `LICENSE.md`) within the source code repository. Users may view, modify, and compile the Source Code for personal use or development purposes, subject to the restrictions in this EULA, particularly those concerning Builds in Section 4. [Optional but Recommended: Clearly state here or in a repo `LICENSE.md` file *how* the source itself is licensed, e.g., "The Source Code, excluding the restrictions on Builds defined herein and the specific license for the Zlibrary Module defined in Section 5, is licensed under the MIT License." and explicitly mention this EULA's override on distribution of Builds.]

**3. SPECIAL CONDITION FOR USERS NAMED ANANYA**
    Notwithstanding any other grants or permissions in this EULA, any User whose legal or commonly known first name is "Ananya" must personally "appreciate" the Licensor (Advik) as a prerequisite condition to being granted any rights to install, use, copy, or otherwise interact with the Software or any Build thereof. Failure to fulfill this condition renders any use of the Software by such individuals unauthorized and a breach of this EULA. The method and verification of this "appreciation" are at the sole discretion of the Licensor.

**4. RESTRICTIONS ON BUILDS AND DISTRIBUTION**
    a. **Distribution Prohibition:** Notwithstanding any rights potentially granted by licenses associated with the Source Code itself (excluding the specific permissions for the Zlibrary Module granted in Section 5), You are strictly prohibited from distributing, redistributing, publishing, sharing, hosting, sublicensing, selling, or making available any Build of the Software, whether modified or unmodified, compiled by You or any third party.
    b. **Authorized Distribution Only:** Only Official Builds distributed directly by the Licensor or through channels explicitly authorized in writing by the Licensor are permitted for installation and use under this EULA. Obtaining or distributing Builds through any other means is a violation of this agreement.
    c. **No Reverse Engineering of Official Builds:** You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble Official Builds, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation.

**5. LIMITED LICENSE FOR ZLIBRARY MODULE CODE**
    a. **Definition:** For the purposes of this section, the "Zlibrary Module" refers exclusively to the code contained within the directory path `zlibrary` located at `https://github.com/Advik-B/The-Blackbook-Archive/tree/main/zlibrary` within the Source Code repository, and any identical or derived code found within a `zlibrary` directory in any fork or branch originating from this Source Code repository.
    b. **Permission to Copy:** Notwithstanding Section 4, You are granted permission to copy, use, modify, and incorporate the code defined as the Zlibrary Module (as per Section 5.a) into other software projects, subject to the attribution requirement below.
    c. **Attribution Requirement:** Any use, distribution, or derivation of the code from the Zlibrary Module, whether obtained from the main repository, a fork, or a branch, must include a clear and conspicuous attribution to the Licensor, **Advik**, and a link back to the original Source Code repository **https://github.com/Advik-B/The-Blackbook-Archive**. This attribution must be included in the source code comments and any accompanying documentation or "About" sections of projects utilizing this code. Failure to provide this attribution revokes the permission granted in this Section 5.
